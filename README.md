# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

## Introduction:

In this project we developed a simple **UNIX** command interpreter "shell" as part of low-level programming foundation and algorithm-Linux and Unix system programming.

## Description:

A simple **UNIX** command interpreter is a program that reads commands from the standard input or files and executes them in order to display a result.

## Requirements:

### General:

+ Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, Using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
+ Your code should use the **Betty** style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
+ Your shell should not have any memory leaks
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ All your header files should be include guarded
+ Use system calls only when you need to ([why?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-system-calls-expensive-in-operating-systems))
